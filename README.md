#Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a standard tic tac toe game. It requires two people to play on the same desktop. Players go back and forth until they can get three in a row. When there's a winner, the winner's shapes turn green and the game locks. To start a new game or to clear the board, just press the 'Reset' button. 

You can clone the project using GitHub directly and can access it at  http://ashahabib.github.io. I tried to keep this project as simple as possible (a bit inspired by the new Balenciaga web design https://www.balenciaga.com/us ). The newest challenge for me was using the canvas element in html and javascript since I do not use this in my current job. You will notice that this project does not include cross browser handling or device responsiveness. In the web library that I use for my job, SAPUI5, the underlying API handles these two concepts. I thought it was best to not use this assignemnt as a playground for new techniques. 

Anyway, how you all enjoy and I hope to here from you soon.
